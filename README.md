# Azure VM Deployment and Monitoring Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates deploying a Virtual Machine (VM) on Azure and setting up monitoring alerts for CPU usage.

## Steps Completed
1. Created Azure free account.
2. Deployed Windows Server 2019 VM named `DemoVM` in `MyDemoAR`.
3. Connected to VM using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).
4. Configured Azure Monitor to send email alerts when CPU usage exceeds 80%.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Azure Portal navigation
- Virtual Machine deployment
- Network and access configuration
- Monitoring and alerting setup

## How to Reproduce
1. Sign up for an Azure free account at [azure.microsoft.com/free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).
2. Follow the VM deployment steps in the Azure Portal.
3. Set up an Azure Monitor alert rule for CPU metrics.
4. Connect to your VM to verify access.

## Future Improvements
- Automate VM deployment using Azure CLI or ARM templates.
- Add monitoring for memory, disk, and network usage.
- Implement auto-scaling or automated shutdown during off-hours.
